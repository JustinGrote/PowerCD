#Set the build numbers to be xxx, example 0.1.0-myfeature001 or 0.2.1-beta001. This allows for longer feature branch names, and can be increased for more active projects
#You should set this to the number of commits you expect to have for a given branch before merging.
#For instance, if vNext is never going to contain more than 99 commits before you push it to master as a new version, you can set this to 2. 3 is good for all but the largest projects.
